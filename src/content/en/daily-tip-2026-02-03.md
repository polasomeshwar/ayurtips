Namaste, everyone!

You know how sometimes, even after a good night's sleep, you just feel a little... *thanda* (cold) or heavy in the mornings, especially these days? Well, our Ayurveda says this time of year, as winter slowly bids goodbye and spring peeks in, our body can feel a bit sluggish. It's because Kapha dosha, which is cool and heavy, starts to gather.

### Why Ginger is Your Best Friend Right Now

Ginger, or *adrak*, is a superstar in Ayurveda, especially when it's cool outside. It's naturally warming and helps to fire up your *agni* (digestive fire). This means your food gets digested better, and you feel lighter and more energetic. Plus, it helps clear out any congestion that might be building up.

### Simple Ginger Tea Recipe for You

No need for fancy stuff, just what's in your kitchen!

*   **What you need:**
    *   A small piece of fresh ginger (about 1 inch)
    *   1 cup water
    *   Honey or jaggery (optional, to taste)
    *   A squeeze of lemon (optional)

*   **How to make it:**
    1.  Grate or thinly slice the ginger. You can even lightly crush it.
    2.  Boil the water with the ginger for about 5-7 minutes. Let all those good flavours and warmth come out!
    3.  Strain the tea into your favourite cup.
    4.  Let it cool down a bit, then add honey or jaggery if you like. Never add honey to very hot liquids, okay?
    5.  A little lemon can add a nice zing too!

### Benefits You'll Feel

*   **Better Digestion:** Say goodbye to that heavy feeling after meals.
*   **Warmth from Inside:** Perfect for these lingering cool days.
*   **Boosts Immunity:** Helps keep those sniffles away.
*   **Clears Congestion:** Great if you feel a bit blocked up.

So, next time you're thinking of your morning cuppa, give this simple ginger tea a try. Your body will thank you, I promise!

Stay warm and healthy, doston!
