## What is Dinacharya?

In Ayurveda, **Dinacharya** (Sanskrit: *din* = day, *acharya* = activity) looks at the cycles of nature and bases daily activities around these cycles. It is a routine that helps to establish balance in one's constitution (doshas).

### Morning Rituals

1.  **Wake up before sunrise (Brahma Muhurta):** This is when nature is calm and peaceful.
2.  **Cleanse:** Brush teeth, scrape tongue, and wash face with cool water.
3.  **Drink warm water:** Activate your digestion.

> "A daily routine is absolutely necessary to bring radical change in body, mind, and consciousness."

Adopting these simple habits can ground you and give you stable energy throughout the day.
