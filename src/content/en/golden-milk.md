## The Magic of Turmeric

**Golden Milk**, or *Haldi Doodh*, has been used in India for centuries. It's not just a trend; it's a potent medicinal tonic.

-   **Digestive**: Ginger and cleaning spices help digestion.

### Simple Recipe
1.  Warm 1 cup of milk (cow or almond).
2.  Add 1/2 tsp turmeric, pinch of black pepper (crucial for absorption).
3.  Add ginger, cinnamon, and a sweetener if desired.

Sip slowly before bed.
